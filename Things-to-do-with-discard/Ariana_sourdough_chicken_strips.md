Modified from [Raspberries & Kahlrabi site's recipe](https://www.raspberriesandkohlrabi.com/baked-sourdough-chicken-tenders/).  

## Ingredients

- 2 pound chicken breasts, sliced thin, or tenderloins
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter (I used Kerrigold)  
- 2 cups Japanese Panko bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 
- 1 cup sourdough starter or discard (< 1 week since last feeding if using discard)
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar 
- 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt 
- 1 tsp parsley
- 1 tsp sage
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions 

1. Brine chicken in a bowl of water and saturated with salt. Allow to sit in salty water for about 1 hour.
2. Rinse chicken and pat dry. 
3. Sprinkle chicken on both sides with 1 tsp kosher salt. 
4.  Whisk together sourdough starter, brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt, parsley, sage, thyme, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and black pepper in a bowl or shallow dish.  
5. Melt the butter in a frying pan at medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and cook until light brown. 
6. Combine toasted bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in a bowl or shallow dish. 
7. Dredge chicken in the starter/spice batter. 
8. Cover with the breadcrumb mixture and press breadcrumbs into batter to make them stick.
9. Preheat overn to 425°F. 
10. Place a metal cooling rack on top of a baking sheet. 
11. Place the prepared chicken strips on top of the cooling rack on the baking sheet. 
12. Spray lightly with Pam or cooking spray. 
13. Bake for 18-22 min to 165°F internal temperature. 
14. If you have a convection or air fry setting on your oven, use it! It will make the chicken even crispier. Just keep an eye on the internal temperature.
