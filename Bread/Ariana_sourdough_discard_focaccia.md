Modified from [Raspberries & Kahlrabi site's recipe](https://www.raspberriesandkohlrabi.com/baked-sourdough-chicken-tenders/).  

## Ingredients

- 500-550 grams bread flour
- 450 grams warm water (80-90°F)
- 100 grams active sourdough starter 
- 10 grams kosher salt
- Flaky salt for sprinkling on top
- 4-5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
- 1-2 tablespoons flavored olive oil (optional) - I love herb infused olive oil 
- Fresh or dried herbs (I used dried thyme, rosemary is also a great choice)

## Instructions 

1. In a large bowl, mix flour, warm water, sourdough starter, and 10 grams kosher salt. The dough will be a bit more wet than a regular sourdough, but it should come together and be able to be shaped with wet hands. If needed, add more flour until the consistency is reached. 
2. Cover with a damp warm towel and allow to rest for 15 min. 
3. Wet hands and grab one edge of the dough. Stretch and pull the dough over itself. Rotate 90 degrees and repeat. Repeat the stretch and folds 16-20 times. Alternatively, knead with a stand mixer. I prefer the stretch and fold method for this wet dough.  
4. Add 1-2 tablespoons olive oil to a clean bowl. Transfer the dough to the clean bowl and use your hands to move the oil around the dough so it doesn't stick. Brush a little oil on top. 
5. Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 6-10 hours depending on kitchen temperature. This can be done all day or over night. 
6. Line 9x13" baking pan with parchment paper and oil with 2 tablespoons more oil. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Use your fingers to spread into the pan. If it does not spread well, let rest for 10 min then spread again. 
7. Cover and let rise for another 2-3 hours or until noticably puffy. The dough can also be refrigerated overnight at this point. 
8. Preheat oven to 375°C. 
9. Oil your hands and gently poke holes across the bread to distribute air bubbles. 
10. Drizzle oil over the top of the dough. You can use plain or flavored oil at this point. 
11. Sprinkel with flaky sea salt and herbs. 
12. Bake for 25-35 min until golden brown and crispy on top. 
13. Allow to cool for 10 min. Remove from pan and slice. Serve warm. 
14. Recommended to serve dipped in flavored olive oil and balsalmic vinegar.
